### Hi there! My name is Ana Adelino

![my face](/assets/images/eu.png){:height="180px"}

I’m a young Portuguese designer, born in 1997. Currently living in Sesimbra, a beautiful small town, near the sea. Came to Lisbon to make a dream come true, study Communication Design in Faculdade de Belas-Artes, Universidade de Lisboa.

I am currently attending a Postgraduate course in Digital Experience Design in the same Faculty. This Postgraduate course is teaching me the best way to develop a Web Project: Starting with the ideia (with a little bit of Marketing knowledge), going through User Research, Prototypes, Wireframes (and many other UX phases), designing the Interface with Pixel Perfection concerns and, lastly, implementing the project on the Web, using Front-End code.

I’m a curious and dedicated person and love to learn new things from new people. I’m passionate about multidisciplinary Design and always try to provide the best solution in every project.
