## Neon Rose
### Free Speech Movement

Neon Rose is a theoretical and informative audiovisual publication that analyses the history and panorama of the student situation, from the 60's, until the present. 

The publication is composed of two booklets: one explains (based on texts and articles) the "Free Speech Movement" counterculture movement, which emerged in the 1960s and the other portrays the current panorama, mainly questioning the price of tuition in Portugal.
