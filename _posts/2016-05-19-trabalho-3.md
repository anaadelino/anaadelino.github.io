## Amazon Redesign
### Digital Product

Redesign of the Amazon website (amazon.com). It was the final project of the main subject of the Posgraduate Course in Digital Experience Design (first semester). The main goals of the project were (among others) to improve the usability and navigability of the website, make the user experience more personalized and improve the readability and orientation on product pages. It was a rather complex challenge and it helped me to consolidate my knowledge in the UX and UI subjects.

## The Process

It was a four step process, composed by Benchmarking, User Research, Website Analysis and Prototyping. The first moment of Benchmarking was composed by the analysis of the Amazon's main competitors and a SWOT analysis to the corporation. Secondly, for the User Research, I developed personas and two userflows. For the Website Analysis the deviverables were a sitemap and sketches of the information architecture of the main pages. Finally, in the Prototyping step, I developed the final mockups and interactive prototypes.
