## Touristing App
### Making Trips Easy

Touristing is a mobile app that goes along with the tourist to his trip, as a way to help him overcome small barriers and make his trip more pleasant and interactive.

**It has three main goals:**

— Break the Language Barrier   
— Inform the traveller of how much “tourist friendly” is an establishment   
— Give important informations and statistics about the City that’s being visited 


## The Process

The process began with defining the concept, organising the ideas and structure the app.
