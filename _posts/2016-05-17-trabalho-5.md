## Touristing App
### Making Trips Easy

Touristing is a mobile app that goes along with the tourist to his trip, as a way to help him overcome small barriers and make his trip more pleasant and interactive.

**It has three main goals:**

— Break the Language Barrier   
— Inform the traveller of how much “tourist friendly” is an establishment   
— Give important informations and statistics about the City that’s being visited 


## The Process

The process began with defining the concept, organising the ideas and structure the app. I also though of the fell and look I would like to explore in the app, for wich reason I looked for inspiration in other apps and created a Moodboard. When I was finally satisfied with the app structure and had a vision on my mind of what the final product could be, I defined the main user flow of the app, folowed by the creation of Hi-Fidelity Wireframes.

After all that process and the defenition of a Style Guide, the last step was to create final mockups and interactive prototypes.
