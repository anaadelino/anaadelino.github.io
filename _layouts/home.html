        <h2>Neon Rose</h2>
        <h3>Editorial + Audiovisual</h3>
        <p>Neon Rose is a theoretical and informative Special Edition about the student situation, from the 60’s to the present.</p><p>It’s divided in two Booklets: The first, based on articles and quotes, frames the Free Speech Movement, a massive, long-lasting student protest which took place during 1964–65, on the campus of the University of California, in Berkeley; The second approaches the present by questioning the way higher education works in Portugal (was complemented with interviews made to Portuguese students).</p>

        <h2>Rosinha, minha canoa</h2>
        <h3>Editorial</h3>
        <p>Divided in two parts, “Rosinha, minha canoa” is a book that treats the relationship between Men and Nature, at a time when little out of the ordinary ideas were considered insane.</p> 
        <p>The special edition I created (compared to the original) adds a full text treatment, typographic design and illustration of the story. The book was impressed in serigraphy and bookbinded by hand.</p>

        <h2>Portugal in Can</h2>
        <h3>Digital + Illustration</h3>
        <p>Portugal in Can was a Digital project that consisted in the creation of an Website based on a traditionally Portuguese object. The one I chose was the well known Portuguese Fish in Can.</p>
        <p>From there, I made a full research on the history of this object, understood which are the most common fish preserved and created illustrations for each one, relating the fish with traditionally Portuguese proverbs.</p>

        <h2>In the mood for love?</h2>
        <h3>Editorial + Audiovisual</h3>
        <p>In the Mood for Love? is a project that covers social issues related to Love and Sex. Its base is the idea of Generation (a group of people born during the same period of time, therefore carrying different perspectives on life).</p> 
        <p>How does Love work today? Does it mean the same as in the past? And Sex? Is Love confused with Sex in our days? These were some of questions we tried to answer in this project. To do that, we divided it into two different moments: The first was a search for the meaning of Love and ways of loving (Cinema Cycle). The second covered the sexuality in the current youth and its vulgarization (Installation).</p> 
        <p>The project culminated in an Audiovisual Publication that reunites all the physical products of our long term work.</p>
